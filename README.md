# Suricata IDS Home-Lab

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èOverview

The goal of setting up a Suricata home-lab is to gain practical experience in deploying and configuring an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network security monitoring. Suricata is an open-source IDS capable of detecting and preventing various network-based threats. This home-lab provides individuals with hands-on experience in setting up, configuring, and utilizing Suricata to enhance network security.
